# Equations-Helper
A web app designed to help make Chemistry equations easier to reference, with a focus on 12th grade CSBE syllabus.
  
Originally was made for my 12th grade project, (filed under Tkinter_Ver). This used Tkinter as the GUI, and also included some functions with matplotlib and a graphing tool to demonstrate that library.  
For the course CSE3001 - Software Engineering, (filed under Flask_Ver) we repurposed this project, and made the frontend with HTML and CSS, interfacing the same python backend via Flask and some AJAX calls.  
  
The intended functionality is to provide 4 drop down boxes, which dynamically change their options based on the other selections. This would allow for quick and easy reference for the reactions that are available in the database.
